## Numerical Programming
The term "Numerical Computing" - a.k.a. numerical computing or scientific computing - can be misleading. One can think about it as "having to do with numbers" as opposed to algorithms dealing with texts. It includes various operations and coputations on large set of data. For this purpose i am using python with it's modules for the computations.Numerical Computing defines an area of computer science and mathematics dealing with algorithms for numerical approximations of problems from mathematical or numerical analysis, in other words: Algorithms solving problems involving continuous variables. Numerical analysis is used to solve science and engineering problems.

## Modules
I am using python with its modules NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and Pandas, it belongs to the top numerical programming languages.
