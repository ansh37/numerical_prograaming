## Numpy Intoduction
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

## How to work with Numpy
Since Numpy can be directly install with python install package
```bash
pip install numpy
```
or you can directly install using anaconda.


## Why Numpy 
Usage of Numpy is in every aspect of science and engineering where computation on large data is required.

I have created jupyter notebook file for Numpy operations. You can refer it as cheatsheet.
